                    This is to represent how I spent a majority of my night programming in Verilog HDL with my lab partner for my degitial design course.

                </ol>

                <p>
                    It's been a little under two weeks since I've had my <strong>ACL reconstruction operation</strong> on my left knee and I was <em>really</em> nervous
                    going to my <b class="to-do">check-up appointment</b>. I had high hopes in them saying I could walk without my crutches; I
                    hate those things. The only good thing that came out of it was me getting the ok to finally take off my 
                    bandages and being complemented on how well my progress in bending my knee is coming along. At the end of the visit, the doctor was
                    impressed as to how fast I put my brace back on. I'm thinking <i>That's interesting, don't all patients start to get pretty fast at this after some time</i>. <br>
                    Later on I was surprised with a burrito when my mother came home from work and it honestly made my day. I vaguely mentioned a craving of my favorite burrito
                    in pasing the other day and here she is walking through the door with it; I love that woman. Towards the 
                    end of the night, I tried to complete a homework assignment <b class="to-do">(Lab 2)</b> a week earlier but my lab partner and I got stuck,
                    we spent three hours trouble shooting the error and got no where; that was rather frustrating but at least we 
                    got a "good" start. I called it quits for the day after that fiasco and just hit the sack. I'd say it was a 
                    pretty productive day though overall.

                    This pretty much summarizes what type of music/songs were playing throughout my roadtrip to LA.

                <h3>Highlights/Lowlights:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comfortably holding my weight on my left knee in the shower for the first time</li>
                    <li>Finally reading lines in my acting class</li>

                    <li>Waiting for an hour to get seated for dinner</li>
                    <li>Did not elevate my knee as much as I should have</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>To-Do:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><input type="checkbox"/> Do my physical therapy for left knee </li>
                    <li><input type="checkbox"/> Watch the rest of my 11am lecture </li>
                    <li><input type="checkbox"/> Watch 4pm lecture recording </li>
                    <li><input type="checkbox"/> Drive to LA safely </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I had no idea when I was leaving to <b class="to-do">drive to LA.</b> I did not want to miss any lectures for that day, but knew I
                    was going to have to miss one so that I don't arrive too late. It was going to have to be my 4pm lecture.
                    The one I was trying to avoid, of course. <i>I hate watching zoom recordings of the class</i>. My friend, who was carpooling with me, and I decided to try and 
                    get to LA at least by 8. We left around noon. There goes another lecture recording I have to watch later... <br>
                    Being able to catch up with an old friend while driving always makes the trip go along faster. Even though it was a 6.5 hour drive, 
                    it definitely didn't feel like that. Forgot how much of a character my friend is, she definitely embodied much of what the Bay represents. As soon as I gave her 
                    control of the music, the first song she played I immediately recognized as it was blaring through the speakers. Cupcake No Fillin is a calssic 
                    Bay Area anthem!! It was a great car ride to say the least. <br>
                    It had been so long since I was able to sit down at a restaurant, so with LA recently lifting that restriction I naturally had to take my girlfirend out to dinner.
                    We decided on <em>Cheesecake Factory</em> and I couldn't have been happier. The wait of almost an hour was brutal but all I could keep thinking about was that 
                    chocolate bread and the appetizers I was about to order. Went to bed with a food baby, and I wasn't mad.

                    I spent the majority of the day being a cat dad; Ollie's only 5 months.

                <ul>
                    <li>Woke up to Ollie on my chest</li>
                    <li>Learned a new coding language</li>
                    <li>Forgot to eat lunch</li>
                    <li>Woke up with some knee pain from yesterday</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>To-Do:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><input type="checkbox"/> Do my physical therapy for left knee </li>
                    <li><input type="checkbox"/> Work/Complete Lab 2 for CSE 110 </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I never really grew up with cats, so being around is still pretty new to me. I'm more of a dog person
                    Ollie warmed up to me pretty fast, I blame how small my girlfriend got him. He was five weeks and the cutest thing
                    I've seen in a long while. <em>What can I say I'm a total softie.</em> I like spending the night at my girlfriend's 
                    house even more because I'm always waking up to Ollie cuddling me in various postions. It's pretty funny. <br>
                    I knew I was going to have the place to myself since my girlfriend and her roommate both work pretty early. I already
                    know the drill, drill meaning Ollie being my responsibilty. I make sure to feed him before I start my physical therapy
                    as I usually do when I first wake up. Working trough the exercises went a lit easier than I expected especially considering
                    the amount of walking I put it through the other day. I finish just in time to be able to make some "breakfast" before my 
                    lab for the day started. These always take me pretty long so I'm anticipating spending a majority of the day completing it. 
                    I always remind myself, <em>You signed up for this!</em>
